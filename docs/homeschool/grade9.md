A popular method for getting advice for one’s problems is to write a letter to an advice column in a magazine. This is often called writing to an “Agony Aunt”.

I have sent you an example of such a letter to an American “agony aunt” called Amy, where someone’s problem is outlined and Amy’s advice given.

#### Assignment

1. Choose any one (1) of the characters in Twelfth Night listed above. Write a letter to “Dear Amy”. Pretend you are the character and outline your problem/s (which must come from the play storyline and not be your own invention). Ask Amy for advice on how to deal with it. Write in modern language.

2. Also write the response from Amy, (the “agony aunt”). This does not need to come from the play storyline – be creative here and give your best advice. 

*Altogether, the piece needs to be between 250 and 350 words. 
Hold onto this piece for later assessment and class sharing.*
