Where children learn start their journey. Nature's gifts are explored through wood, sea shells, stones, pine cones, lamb's wool, as well as art and healthy outdoor play.

Formal intellectual schooling is purposely excluded from the Nursery as this is considered to be inappropriate for this stage of the child's development.
