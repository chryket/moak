## TRAFFIC AND PARKING

We ask all parents to please observe our unofficial
one-way system around the block -- see the
diagram below.

In particular, please also take note of the following:

Marlow Road:

 - Drop & Go at the main gate: Please tell your child/ren to be ready to get out of your car so you can
drive off quickly. We need a quick turnaround of cars in this drop off area.

- Parking is allowed on the school side of this road
(but not on yellow/red lines).

- Absolutely No Parking on the opposite (south)
side of this road, at all times, to ensure smooth
flow of cars down Marlow Road.

Sheerness Road:

- This is for staff parking only 
	- **no parents to park there at any time of the day/night.**

Gibson / Bolus Intersection:

- No parking on the street corners or close to the
pedestrian crossing.

**Thank you for helping us keep traffic moving!**
