## History

The school occupies a hectare of rambling grounds in quiet surroundings, close to Kenilworth station in Cape Town.

The school is founded on the principles of Steiner education, which at its core focuses teaching around the needs of the growing child rather than the needs of a dictated curriculum.

Michael Oak was started in 1962 in a house off Rosmead Avenue. 

The Old House was bought by parents on an auction and provided the first classrooms for the 15 pupils. 

School assemblies were held in the present reception foyer. Bricks were laid by parents and the first classrooms completed with their hard work.

 More classrooms were followed by a school hall, then a neighbour's house was bought for the kindergarten.
 
 **The rest has been a story of continuing growth and development, where parents, staff and pupils form a vibrant and strong school community, a school where teachers really love to teach.**
