THE GRADE 11 TO MATRIC TEACHERS
We include here a brief introduction to each teacher.

RICHARD COX —Dip BD Agric. (Emerson), BA (UNISA)
Richard started out with a scientific training with physics, botany, soil science and animal husbandry. His training was in Biodynamic/ecological farming at Emerson College in Britain. There he had the wonderful opportunity to pursue a special interest in Projective Geometry and did supplementary courses with Olive Whicher who wrote two definitive books on the subject. His years at Emerson College provided a solid grounding in Steiner’s researches. After 12 years farming he took up studies in the arts earning a BA in History and Ancient History. His experience in metalwork, woodwork and bookbinding arose from interest and pure enjoyment.

GRAHAM SCANNELL — BA (UCT), Hons (Pmb), HDE (UCT)
Graham taught matric English, first and second language, and put on plays, in Mitchells Plain state high schools for 7 years in the turbulent 80’s. During this time, his appreciation and study of Waldorf education deepened. In 1990 he was asked to join the pioneer Michael Oak High School which had started the previous year and ever since that, he has been integral to the main lesson teaching program (covering in Grade 8 – the skeleton, the industrial revolution. the physics of atmospheric pressure and heat engines; in Grade 9 – the circulatory system, electromagnetism, the build-up and erosion of mountains, and drama; in Grade 10 – The Iliad and Odyssey by Homer). He has taught the running English lessons in Grade 9 and 10; and running maths lessons in Grade 8 and 9. He has produced 24 annual Shakespeare plays, a highlight of Grade 9. An extra-curricular pursuit of his entails researching the question of who really wrote the works of Shakespeare!

DERINA WILLE — B.A. STD (Stell)
Derina taught languages and maths in mainstream schools before becoming a programmer and systems analyst in the mainframe computer world, where she worked for many years. She joined Michael Oak as a mother in the 90's, and subsequently taught Afrikaans in the Primary School for seven years. The Afrikaans plays by Grade 6 were a feature of that time and a fond memory for many. She joined the High School faculty in 2007 as maths teacher, happy to follow a life-long passion for maths.

GILLIAN MATHEW —Dip Fine Art (Cape Technikon)
After obtaining her diploma (majoring in painting), Gillian lived in Paris for a year, studying colour etching at the Cité des Artes. For many years she created illustrations for children’s books, during which time she also joined Michael Oak to teach in the High School (on the same day that her daughter started Nursery School). Gillian feels fortunate to have completed the Bridging Polarities Through Art course and is currently attending the in-service Waldorf teacher’s training course.

WINIFRED BOND — MAOT (Oxford)(UK)
Winifred trained as an Occupational Therapist in UK. She came to South Africa as a volunteer in the early 70s, using her handwork/ craft skills and interest in doing ‘home industries’ on a Mission in KZN. She worked at the General Hospital Hillbrow and in the Adolescent department at Tara Hospital. After spending time in Mocambique; Southern Cape (where she taught pottery to adults at the technikon); and Los Angeles, the Bonds arrived with three children in Cape Town. As an ex-Waldorf pupil of Michael Hall, UK, and encouraged by the diversity of Michael Oak at that time, her children started their schooling here. She ran a Waldorf playgroup while the youngest child was still at home and then took the handwork teacher post at Michael Oak when the high school development was in its infancy. She has enjoyed sharing her wide crafting experience ever since to all ages.

DIANE SCANNELL — Dip Movement Studies (ETA), Dip Lifestyle Counselling (ETA)
Diane has been teaching in the high school since 1995. She teaches the Grade 9s in dance, movement, speech and drama. She is also a director of the annual Shakespeare play. Diane had her first stage performance at the tender age of 5. As an 8-year-old veteran she was offered a bursary to study classical ballet at UCT! She has spent her life and training, one way or another, involved in stage and theatre, dance and dance exercise. Diane did 3 years of Waldorf teacher training at the Centre for Creative Education, also lecturing there in Child Development and Drama. She was part of the pioneer group of teachers at the Gaia Waldorf School.


ESTELLE GELDENHUYS — BA HED (RAU), BA Fine Art (UCT), P Dip M&E (Stell)
Estelle joined Michael Oak at the start of 2012 to teach Afrikaans. Her undergraduate studies include majors in Afrikaans-Nederlands, Psychology, History and Theory of Art, Printmaking and Graphic Design. Her career included positions as teacher, communications officer, staff trainer and map librarian before she joined the non-governmental sector as proposal writer in the mid-1990s. In this position she visited many of Cape Town’s shack settlements to document conditions of poverty for funders, and researched a range of developmental needs, including early childhood education, youth development and human rights education. The demand for impact assessments led to her completing a Monitoring & Evaluation Diploma in 2010.

ROY DAVIDS —HDE Practical Specialisation in Physical Education
