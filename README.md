## Basic Requirements 

- be able to open a terminal(`ctl-alt-T`) or command prompt(windows 10 search for `powershell`).
- be able to change directories. `cd mydirectory`
- be able to create, rename,edit and delete files and folders
- be able to take a screenshot or copy paste and save error messages

If you can do all of these carry on ...


## step 1

- install a python [environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) on your computer. [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or [just conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html) seems to work quite nicely across different platforms but use what works for you. 

You dont have to understand the code after this, you just need to know how to make it work for you

- follow the mkdocs [installation]((https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation)) instructions.

## step 2

if you are still here have a look at the [wiki][https://github.com/chryket/moak/wiki]
