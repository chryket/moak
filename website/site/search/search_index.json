The school is founded on the principles of Steiner education, which at its core focuses teaching around the needs of the growing child rather than the needs of a dictated curriculum. Michael Oak was started in 1962 in a house off Rosmead Avenue. The Old House was bought by parents on an auction and provided the first classrooms for the 15 pupils. School assemblies were held in the present reception foyer. Bricks were laid by parents and the first classrooms completed with their hard work. More classrooms were followed by a school hall, then a neighbour's house was bought for the kindergarten. The rest has been a story of continuing growth and development, where parents, staff and pupils form a vibrant and strong school community, a school where teachers really love to teach. Governance Michael Oak Waldorf School is based on a foundation of strong parent involvement and teachers who are passionate about educating children. It is the active involvement of parents that make the community of Michael Oak so special. The school is governed by an active Board of Trustees comprising both parents and teachers.

It is the active involvement of parents that make the community of Michael Oak so special. The school is governed by a board of Trustees comprising parents and teachers. The College of Teachers is responsible for the application of the curriculum and the day-to-day to running of the school. Different sub-committees and working groups fulfil vital roles and functions that keep the school working as a vibrant collective. Parents are encouraged to become involved. Trustees In terms of the Notarial Trust Deed of the Michael Oak School Association, the Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the objective of the Trust is achieved, essentially to organise and promote the teaching of children in accordance with the principles and methods expounded by Rudolf Steiner. The Trustees are also responsible for the long term sustainability and the legal and financial stability of the school. Their roles and responsibilities are set out in the Board of Trustees Charter and depicted in the governance Organogram. The Trustees comprise of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve members, at least three of whom need to be teachers. The parent members are selected annually as recommended by the Nominations Committee, which is made up of two members each from College, the current Trustees and the Links Group. The Trustees can co-opt new members in the course of the year where space allows. College of Teachers The College of Teachers is responsible for the pedagogical needs and the overall running of the school. Essentially, the group fulfils the functions of a school principal. The College meets on Thursday afternoons, and tasks (such as chairperson) are rotated and shared. The members study together, conduct interviews, receive visitors, handle correspondence and address discipline issues and other problems that have not been dealt with in the weekly teachers' meetings. All is dealt with in confidence. All correspondence is answered and confidentiality is maintained \u2013 there is a holding slot in the office for receiving correspondence, or it can be emailed to info@michaeloak.org.za . It should reach the school by Wednesday 08h00 for inclusion on the agenda for that week, although it may be held over for a week, depending on pressure of other business. Parents' concerns: If parents have a concern about a child or the school, it is usually taken to the class teacher first. However such issues may also be raised with any individual members of the College to take to their meeting, or correspondence can be directed to the College as a whole. Faculty Teachers Each School faculty - Kindergarten (including Playgroup), Primary and High School - meets weekly to discuss day-to-day school issues, curriculum progress, and any classroom difficulties. An important aspect of the meetings is to focus on individual children in order to understand them better and help them forward in an appropriate way. The applications of children interviewed are presented to the faculty before the child is accepted. The Class Links The Class Links are a vital cog in the life of the school. Each class has a parent or parents (links) who act as liaison between parents, teacher and school. They are a communication channel for the class family and help to organise class events, fundraising and Fair activities. The communication between parents and teachers, College and Trustees is one of the most important functions of the links body. The class links meet as a group twice a term, and teacher, College and Trustee representatives also attend this meeting. Two links are chosen by the group to form part of the Nominations Committee (see Trustee section for explanation). The class links are generally selected by the whole class community and the teacher/guardian of that class. If parents of a new class do not know each other well enough to nominate a class link, or if no parent comes forward, the teacher may ask a particular parent to act as the class link until the situation changes. Admin Group The Admin Group\u2019s key responsibilities are the administration of the school, including secretarial, accounting, enrolment, marketing and events. The Admin Group meets twice a month and provides support for the teaching staff, children and parents in a myriad ways. FinCom The Finance & Audit Committee's key responsibilities are: administration, financial systems and planning, the monthly management accounts and cash flow, the annual budget and recommended fee increases, recommendations to the Tustees on the appointment of the auditors, the annual audit and preparation of the annual financial statements. The following working groups are accountable to Fincom: the finance side of the Admin Group, Debtors Group and Audit Group. High School Forum Extract from the HS Forum Terms of Reference: Composition The High School Forum are volunteer parents preferably from each High School class 8-12 inclusive. The HS Forum is an open forum and every High School parent who wishes to attend the High School Forum is encouraged to attend. The role of the HS Forum is to provide a discussion space for HS parents on High School matters that are not learner-, teacher-, or parent-specific, and to assist and support the HS Faculty with the smooth running and development of the High School. The Forum also wishes to facilitate a deeper understanding of the methods and approach of a Waldorf High School. The HSF has no decision-making mandate, it is a discussion forum only, accountable to the HS Faculty (and thus to the CoT). The HSF forum meets once per term, and the dates are pre-advertised in the Leaflet and in the school\u2019s Google calendar. A call for agenda items is emailed out to all HS parents & teachers, well in advance of the termly meeting \u2013 all ideas, issues and concerns are welcome and this is the \u2018informal\u2019 forum to share these.","title":"Working Groups"},{"location":"about/working_groups/#working-groups","text":"Michael Oak is a school run by its parents and teachers.

Our Questions and Answers section below provides some Michael Oak context. How are Children Taught to Read? Translating lines of abstract symbols into reality is a complex and stressful challenge for young minds. The Waldorf curriculum does not rush children into reading too early. For the first two grades there is a greater focus on the spoken word through verse and narrative, on the alphabet and writing. Letters of the alphabet are learned first as capitals. Humans perceived, pictured, and then developed signs and written symbols. The children follow that path. We discover the shapes of the letters: M in a series of mountain peaks, V in the valleys between, S in a sinuous snake. The first printed readers are introduced during the second year. Around the end of third grade reading skills are on par with standard school curricula. How is Number Work Introduced? It is generally recognised that the first experiences of arithmetic are crucial, and here Steiner made some interesting recommendations. By starting with \"two plus two equals four\", the child meets (i) a completely abstract proposition, (ii) a reductionist view of the universe in which wholes are made up of parts, and (iii) a problem with only one answer. Instead if he explores how to divide an apple or a cake and share it round the class, he starts from real life, from wholeness, and from a problem with several answers. Arithmetic is taught to children not as a method for computing, but as a powerful process which is inscribed into the world around them. They can see oneness in the image of the sun, twoness in the contrasts of day and night, fiveness in flower petals and sixness in the legs of beetles. Always, there is a sense of the reality underpinning the world. Numbers are taught in movement, and through music before anything is committed to paper. They can be modelled in plasticine, clay or beeswax, together with the shapes in which they are found: the square, circle, pentagon and so on. Arithmetic tables are recited with much clapping and stamping, for unless the knowledge sinks deeper than the child's conscious memory, very little has been achieved. As in so much else, in their early years the children need to learn by heart before they learn by head. Why do Primary School teachers stay with the same class? Primary school classes keep the same teacher for at least the first 4 years, and generally another teacher for the next 3 years. While the diversity of the curriculum demands specialist subject teachers, we aim at a balance between these specialists and the class teacher who becomes the pupils' guide and friend. The class with its class teacher moves through the school as a single unit. This practice has many social advantages. It also takes account of the fact that a child's speed or slowness in one subject or area of school life is almost always matched by an opposite in other areas. The class teacher's connection with the class achieves four valuable educational objectives: The teacher's continuous and deepening knowledge of the children in his class. An increasingly intimate connection between teachers and parents, fostering greater understanding of and security for the pupil. The continued development of the teacher. An interrelationship between subject matter taught in early and later years which enriches the curriculum even further. Why Is Art Regarded As So Important? Art is recognised as an important aid to learning. It permeates the curriculum as a medium of expression and enlivens all subjects. By teaching with imagination, movement, sound and much artistic activity, the whole nature of the child is aroused and involved, developing enthusiasm for the learning experience. Learning is transformed into a stimulating process with far-reaching results when enriched with art and movement, enabling the whole person to unfold. The Main Lesson - What Is That? Every morning for the first two hours of the day, the children are at their most receptive and greater concentration can be expected. This 'Main Lesson' period is devoted to one subject at a time, over a period of 2 to 4 weeks. This allows the teacher time to address the subject in depth, integrating activities, intellectual and creative work. Through this immersion in each core subject, we seek to draw the pupil in, to unlock wonder, enthusiasm and a desire to learn more. And, as he works more intensively, his powers of concentration are strengthened. Language, mathematics, history, geography and the sciences are taught during these periods and are all presented in a way that stimulates in turn the emotions, the thinking and the physical activity of the child. The rest of the school day is more conventional, with 45 minute periods devoted to other languages, core subject refreshers, skills, music, singing and eurythmy. Handwork, craft lessons, painting, modelling, gymnastics and games are scheduled at the end of the school day. Memories of the involvement and enthusiasm gained during the morning and day are what should accompany the child into sleep, to be digested and dreamed and become long-term memories. Television and computer games effectively destroy this process. What Importance Is Given To The Sciences In The High School? We live in a highly scientific and technological age. The study of sciences plays a crucial role in preparing the young adult to understand and integrate into today's world. An understanding of the discovery and workings of machinery, electronics and energy sources, and the implications these have for human life, is one of the most important aspects of life-long learning. Rather than memorising pre-programmed, fixed laws from a text book, the pupil's study of science begins primarily from their own observations. By working from observed phenomena, engaging, thinking, and arriving at their own insights and conclusions they learn the scientific method and its rewards. Physics and chemistry become real as ways of understanding and exploring our world and our universe. Pupils also study the dramatic biographies of remarkable personalities whose discoveries changed and moulded our civilisation, providing context and real-life understanding of the scientific journey of discovery.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"information/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Visit Why Waldorf Works for a great FAQ section addressing many of the frequent questions on Waldorf education.

Around the end of third grade reading skills are on par with standard school curricula.","title":"How are Children Taught to Read?"},{"location":"information/faq/#how-is-number-work-introduced","text":"It is generally recognised that the first experiences of arithmetic are crucial, and here Steiner made some interesting recommendations. By starting with \"two plus two equals four\", the child meets (i) a completely abstract proposition, (ii) a reductionist view of the universe in which wholes are made up of parts, and (iii) a problem with only one answer. Instead if he explores how to divide an apple or a cake and share it round the class, he starts from real life, from wholeness, and from a problem with several answers. Arithmetic is taught to children not as a method for computing, but as a powerful process which is inscribed into the world around them. They can see oneness in the image of the sun, twoness in the contrasts of day and night, fiveness in flower petals and sixness in the legs of beetles. Always, there is a sense of the reality underpinning the world. Numbers are taught in movement, and through music before anything is committed to paper. They can be modelled in plasticine, clay or beeswax, together with the shapes in which they are found: the square, circle, pentagon and so on. Arithmetic tables are recited with much clapping and stamping, for unless the knowledge sinks deeper than the child's conscious memory, very little has been achieved. As in so much else, in their early years the children need to learn by heart before they learn by head.","title":"How is Number Work Introduced?"},{"location":"information/faq/#why-do-primary-school-teachers-stay-with-the-same-class","text":"Primary school classes keep the same teacher for at least the first 4 years, and generally another teacher for the next 3 years. While the diversity of the curriculum demands specialist subject teachers, we aim at a balance between these specialists and the class teacher who becomes the pupils' guide and friend. The class with its class teacher moves through the school as a single unit. This practice has many social advantages. It also takes account of the fact that a child's speed or slowness in one subject or area of school life is almost always matched by an opposite in other areas. The class teacher's connection with the class achieves four valuable educational objectives: The teacher's continuous and deepening knowledge of the children in his class. An increasingly intimate connection between teachers and parents, fostering greater understanding of and security for the pupil. The continued development of the teacher. An interrelationship between subject matter taught in early and later years which enriches the curriculum even further.","title":"Why do Primary School teachers stay with the same class?"},{"location":"information/faq/#why-is-art-regarded-as-so-important","text":"Art is recognised as an important aid to learning. It permeates the curriculum as a medium of expression and enlivens all subjects. By teaching with imagination, movement, sound and much artistic activity, the whole nature of the child is aroused and involved, developing enthusiasm for the learning experience. Learning is transformed into a stimulating process with far-reaching results when enriched with art and movement, enabling the whole person to unfold.","title":"Why Is Art Regarded As So Important?"},{"location":"information/faq/#the-main-lesson-what-is-that","text":"Every morning for the first two hours of the day, the children are at their most receptive and greater concentration can be expected. This 'Main Lesson' period is devoted to one subject at a time, over a period of 2 to 4 weeks. This allows the teacher time to address the subject in depth, integrating activities, intellectual and creative work. Through this immersion in each core subject, we seek to draw the pupil in, to unlock wonder, enthusiasm and a desire to learn more. And, as he works more intensively, his powers of concentration are strengthened. Language, mathematics, history, geography and the sciences are taught during these periods and are all presented in a way that stimulates in turn the emotions, the thinking and the physical activity of the child. The rest of the school day is more conventional, with 45 minute periods devoted to other languages, core subject refreshers, skills, music, singing and eurythmy. Handwork, craft lessons, painting, modelling, gymnastics and games are scheduled at the end of the school day. Memories of the involvement and enthusiasm gained during the morning and day are what should accompany the child into sleep, to be digested and dreamed and become long-term memories. Television and computer games effectively destroy this process.","title":"The Main Lesson - What Is That?"},{"location":"information/faq/#what-importance-is-given-to-the-sciences-in-the-high-school","text":"We live in a highly scientific and technological age. The study of sciences plays a crucial role in preparing the young adult to understand and integrate into today's world. An understanding of the discovery and workings of machinery, electronics and energy sources, and the implications these have for human life, is one of the most important aspects of life-long learning. Rather than memorising pre-programmed, fixed laws from a text book, the pupil's study of science begins primarily from their own observations. By working from observed phenomena, engaging, thinking, and arriving at their own insights and conclusions they learn the scientific method and its rewards. Physics and chemistry become real as ways of understanding and exploring our world and our universe. Pupils also study the dramatic biographies of remarkable personalities whose discoveries changed and moulded our civilisation, providing context and real-life understanding of the scientific journey of discovery.","title":"What Importance Is Given To The Sciences In The High School?"},{"location":"information/parking/","text":"TRAFFIC AND PARKING We ask all parents to please observe our unofficial one-way system around the block -- see the diagram below.

The school was opened in 1919 to serve the needs of factory workers' children. Considered revolutionary at the time, the methods have proved themselves to be thoroughly practical and effective. Waldorf Education is a holistic response to the question \"How can education best serve the growth of the individual and of society?\" Waldorf education is based on three key elements: understanding the stages in the development of the child as a moral being; understanding what the child needs, and what they will respond to at each stage in their path to adulthood; developing a curriculum and teaching methodology that supports and guides the growing child. Waldorf Education aims at providing a warm, rich, enjoyable yet challenging education in which the needs of the whole child are met throughout school life. It aims at a preparation for life in the broadest sense and for life-long learning. The curriculum is designed to bring balance into education by systematically addressing the whole child in every activity. Each subject taught needs to address the head, heart and hands of the child. Mathematics, for example, needs to engender feelings of wonder and curiosity while integrated practical activities deepen the experience and knowledge. Waldorf Education is designed to be in harmony with the inner and outer needs of the child at every stage of their development. Time and care is taken to travel every step of the way with each child, to allow the young adult to emerge with self-confidence, enthusiasm, awareness, equipped with knowledge and ready to take on the world. The practical application of the Waldorf curriculum The curriculum is designed with the growing child in mind. Year by year, following the different stages of childhood, the curriculum seeks to mirror the inner development of the child, to give the child the experiences that they need, and the learning to which they will be most receptive. This makes the lessons both relevant and satisfying. All the important material in standard South African and international curriculums is covered, though not always in the same order. As far as possible, different subjects are taught as an integrated whole with one subject enhancing another. The Waldorf curriculum also emphasises practical application of the subjects through physical activity, craft work and skills, drama, song and movement. That can mean building a wooden house in Grade 3, to spending six months immersed in producing and performing a Shakespeare play in Grade 9. The Main Lesson is a key concept in the Waldorf curriculum. The first 2 hours of each school morning are spent exclusively on a subject - and each subject is tackled over a number of days or weeks. Through the course of the year the child meets their core subjects several times through focussed main lesson blocks. THE MAIN LESSON written by Joan Sleigh The Main Lesson, a period of two hours at the start of every morning, is a central feature in Waldorf Education. Subjects are taught in blocks of three or four weeks, thus enabling a deep engagement with one main topic at a time. Each main lesson period is structured in a threefold way, consciously stimulating and developing the faculties of mental, emotional and intentional learning. The teaching in a Steiner Waldorf school comes essentially 'through' the teacher and not via text books. The teacher chooses the material and presentation to suit the particular group of children. The fundamental mode of delivery for lesson content is the immediate and direct interface between pupils and teacher.(Rawson & Richter; 2005; 22) The teacher prepares each lesson in depth, thus internalising the content so that he or she can present it in an imaginative lively narrative. Daily reflection on the success of each lesson and necessary adjustments to meet the pupils is a vital part of healthy teaching and learning. For this reason text books are used as preparation material for the teacher, whereas the pupils receive an imaginative and experiential presentation of the subject matter. This process of personal, artistic and practical engagement with the content is reflected in the Main Lesson books, designed and created by each pupil. They write their own \u2018text books\u2019, each one being a unique, individual and creative documentation of the work covered, reflective of the engagement and understanding of the \u2018author\u2019.

Each main lesson period is structured in a threefold way, consciously stimulating and developing the faculties of mental, emotional and intentional learning. The teaching in a Steiner Waldorf school comes essentially 'through' the teacher and not via text books. The teacher chooses the material and presentation to suit the particular group of children. The fundamental mode of delivery for lesson content is the immediate and direct interface between pupils and teacher. (Rawson & Richter; 2005; 22) The teacher prepares each lesson in depth, thus internalising the content so that he or she can present it in an imaginative lively narrative. Daily reflection on the success of each lesson and necessary adjustments to meet the pupils is a vital part of healthy teaching and learning. For this reason text books are used as preparation material for the teacher, whereas the pupils receive an imaginative and experiential presentation of the subject matter. This process of personal, artistic and practical engagement with the content is reflected in the Main Lesson books, designed and created by each pupil. They write their own \u2018text books\u2019, each one being a unique, individual and creative documentation of the work covered, reflective of the engagement and understanding of the \u2018author\u2019. The teacher uses the Main Lesson book as the primary tool of evaluation and assessment. The cognitive, artistic and personal involvement of each child becomes visible at a glance. This multi-faceted approach to learning takes time and effort, but ensures a deep involvement and internalisation of the subject.","title":"THE MAIN LESSON"}]}
