GUIDING FRAMEWORK AND AIMS

3. We are committed to dealing with every reported incident of bullying as quickly as possible.
4. We aim to be constructive and consistent, in our approach to bullying.
5. We aim to be guided by individual situations and age appropriateness.
6. We  believe  that  bullying  can  be  resolved  in  a  constructive  way  when  all  parties acknowledge their role in a conflict and its resolution.
7. We  judge  the  behaviour,  not  the  learner;  avoiding  blaming  or  shaming  of  any  parties involved,  while  still  acknowledging that  they  must  be  held  accountable for  their  actions. We aim to offer appropriate support to all parties involved.  
8. Parents are expected to follow the procedure of the school and not to take matters into their own hands.
