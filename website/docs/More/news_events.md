## Welcome Back!

Welcome Back!
Dear Michael Oak Community,
A warm welcome to you all as we begin 2020. We extend a special welcome
to the new staff, pupils and families who have joined us. We wish you a long
and happy association with Michael Oak.
Last year we celebrated 100 years of Waldorf Education in the world. This
year our focus is looking ahead – visioning and planning for the years to
come. As a start, the entire complement of staff participated in a visioning
workshop on Monday. This work will be continued by the board of trustees
and the college of teachers in February. This is an exciting time as we start
the new decade, and we look forward to sharing this vision with you all
We would like to congratulate our 2019 Matrics on their excellent results -see full details in next week's Leaflet. We thank every teacher, from
Playgroup to Matric, who have all played a part in the lives and learning of
these students. We wish them well for their future endeavours. Please let us
know where life is taking you.
We would like to thank the support staff for all the work they did during the
holidays to prepare the buildings and grounds for the start of the new school
year.
In Waldorf Education we strive to educate the whole human being. Even on
our small campus this is possible. We are privileged to be able to be
observers of, and participants in, the fullness of our children’s development –
from Playgroup to Matric.
We wish you a wonderful, prosperous and peaceful year.
