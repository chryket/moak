# About Our School

The school occupies a hectare of rambling grounds in quiet surroundings, close to Kenilworth station in Cape Town.

The school is founded on the principles of Steiner education, which at its core focuses teaching around the needs of the growing child rather than the needs of a dictated curriculum.

Michael Oak was started in 1962 in a house off Rosmead Avenue. 

The Old House was bought by parents on an auction and provided the first classrooms for the 15 pupils. 

School assemblies were held in the present reception foyer. Bricks were laid by parents and the first classrooms completed with their hard work.

 More classrooms were followed by a school hall, then a neighbour's house was bought for the kindergarten.
 
 **The rest has been a story of continuing growth and development, where parents, staff and pupils form a vibrant and strong school community, a school where teachers really love to teach.**

Michael Oak is a registered independent school and a member of the Independent Schools Association in South Africa (ISASA).

The school is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising parents and teachers. The College of Teachers serves the pedagogical needs of the school and essentially fulfils the role of school principal.

There are sixteen Waldorf schools in South Africa registered with the S.A. Federation of Waldorf Schools, and well over 1000 of these schools throughout the world, with many opening every year.
